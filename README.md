# Front End Project Starter

A very strict project configuration / boilerplate for front end projects. It features many ESLint and Stylelint plugins (including enforcing a Stylelint class pattern) and an aggressive git hook which runs on every commit.

## Features

Main features include:

- React.
- Webpack dev server for a great server with live-reloading capabilities and HTTPS.
- Dynamic imports and code splitting.
- Caching with hashes in filenames for JavaScript and CSS.
- JavaScript transpilation with Babel (options for modern browsers / IE11 commented out in babel.config.js).
- Strict ESLint and Stylelint with many plugins for good development practices
  - Stylint rule "selector-class-pattern" is enabled, enforcing a SCSS class pattern of BemBlock_bemElement\_\_\_bemModifier.
- Jest with jsdom for fast unit testing and integration testing.
  - Also enforces 90% code coverage.
- Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Aggressive git hook to ensure the build passes in every commit, which runs:
  - Prettier code formatter in write mode.
  - ESLint and Stylelint in fix mode.
  - All the tests for Jest and Cypress, ensuring they all pass and code coverage threshold is met.
- PostCSS with things like autoprefixer and cssnano (to minify our CSS code).
- A lot of NPM scripts for different use cases.

The reason for all of these is that I believe code quality and passing tests are important. Also I believe it's ideal for a repository to always be stable, so that it's possible to revert to any commit. If really needed the git hook can always be bypassed and the test coverage threshold modified.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- NPM

Installation requires [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is included with [Node](https://nodejs.org/). You can install Node by downloading the installer from the website.

To update NPM to the latest version:

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/sargalias/front-end-project-starter.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```
npm install
```

### Using in your project without future updates

Just delete the .git folder in your project and start a create a new git repository with `git init`.

Note: In some operating systems the .git folder is hidden. You may need to turn on the "show hidden files" option.

### Using in your project with future updates

One way to use this project is to keep a dedicated branch and remote for it. That way you can keep getting updates and merging them in your project.

#### Setup

1. Rename the remote to "config"

```
git remote rename origin config
```

2. Checkout a new branch "config"

```
git checkout -b config
```

#### Updating

1. Pull updates

```
git checkout config
git pull config master
```

2. Merge those updates in your working branch

```
git checkout my-work-branch
git merge config
```

## Usage

There are many commands / NPM scripts included.

### Starting the project

- Start the project on a local server: `npm start`

### Building the project

- Build the project for production: `npm run build`
- Build the project for development (linting errors won't fail the build): `npm run build:dev`

### Running the tests

- Start the project on a local server along with Cypress (E2E tests): `npm run start-with-cypress`
- Run all tests (Jest and Cypress): `npm run test:all`
- Run Jest tests: `npm test`
- Run Jest tests without coverage: `npm run test:no-coverage`
- Run Jest tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`

- Open Cypress (requires a server running): `npm run cy:open`
- Run Cypress tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Run Cypress tests if a server is already running: `npm run cy:run`

### Code formatting and linting

- Format code with code formatter: `npm run format`
- Run lint check: `npm run lint`
- Run lint check in fix mode: `npm run lint:fix`
- Run lint check for SCSS only: `npm run lint:scss`
- Run lint check for JavaScript only: `npm run lint:js`
- Run lint check in fix mode for SCSS only: `npm run lint:fix:scss`
- Run lint check in fix mode for JavaScript only: `npm run lint:fix:js`

### Build pipeline

- Run the entire build process (code formatting, linting in fix mode, all tests): `npm run ci`

## Notes

For every option and configuration, please see the relevant documentation. E.g. for any Stylelint issues, please see the Stylelint docs and / or docs for the relevant Stylelint plugin.

### Note about the git hook

There is a pretty aggressive Git hook which runs the entire build process for every commit, ensuring linting and tests pass.

If needed, you can disable the Git hook by deleting the **.huskyrc** file, or using the `--no-verify` flag during commits. E.g.

### Note about the code coverage threshold

The code coverage threshold with Jest is set to 90%. This can be changed by modifying the jest.config.js file. The option is `coverageThreshold: { global: {/* ... */} }`.
